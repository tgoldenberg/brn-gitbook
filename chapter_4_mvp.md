# Chapter 4: MVP 
## 4.0 Putting Together the pieces

Last chapter we left with the start of our project -- a working `Navigator` and a designed landing page. Next we're going to implement a TabBar navigation inside of our `Dashboard` component.

Let's start with 3 tabs - Dashboard, Messages, and Profile. We'll them fill out the screens with fake data. First replace the contents of `application/components/Dashboard.js`. Notice that we use the `react-native-vector-icons` package to customize our tab bar.
