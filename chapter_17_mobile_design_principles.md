# Chapter 17: App Design for Non-Designers


React Native is incredible technology. The framework makes it possible for a single web developer to create an entire app herself. To be sure, this is progress.

But with great power comes great responsibility. Now that you *can* build a whole app yourself, how do you make sure it's actually usable? It's completely possible to be a great developer and not have the first idea about how to make your app intuitive and attractive.

We've got you covered. You don't need to hire a designer or spend years at art school to build an app your users will love. In this chapter we'll cover the basics of good design, as well as some resources to get you started. 

## Principle #1: Code is Expensive; Design First

When you're getting started with a new mobile project, it can be tempting to just dive right in and start building. There are some situations in which this makes sense - maybe you're trying to learn a new technology, or building a quick proof-of-concept of something tricky. But for he most part, you shouldn't write a line of code until you have a pretty good idea of what you're building.

Why should you design first? No matter how good of a developer you are, you can always work through design ideas with illustrations faster than you can code them. Moreover, a lot of newer design tools are more intuitive than their bloated precursors. 

Find your way to a great app design is about rapidly generating rough sketches, running them by potential users, and keeping the ones that work. 

Here's an example of why designing first makes more sense. Let's say you're trying to plan the navigation structure of your app, and you are trying to decide between tabbed browsing or using hamburger menu. Both have their merits, but you want to make sure you're picking the right one for your use case. The last thing you want is to go with one approach, code it, release it, only to realize your users find it confusing. A far better approach is to whip up a couple of quick sketches, and see which one people prefer. Design ideas are cheap, they can be discarded quickly if they don't work, but code takes time to rewrite and test.

###Sketching out Ideas

You don't need any design talent to scratch out some rough ideas and run them by friends or potential users. Here are some no-nonsense tools to get you started

#### Sketch

[Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) is one of the most intuitive design tools I've ever seen. While programs like Adobe Illustrator have extremely steep learning curves, a complete newbie can be drawing app ideas in Sketch in minutes. It even comes with templates for app design pre-configured for the right dimensions. Basically, you can draw shapes and add text quickly and a rough mockup of an app idea in no time. It also comes with great tools for exporting assets and an extensive plugin library. 

Disclaimer: Sketch costs $99 for the full version, but I can say it is absolutely worth it if you're going to be doing regular sketching, and it's far cheaper than it's competitors. It does have a 30-day free trial if you expect to only need it for a few weeks.
