# Chapter 3: The Beginnings of an App

## Create an App

1. We're going to start a new React Native project. First create a directory where you will store all folders related to the app -- `mkdir assemblies` - `cd assemblies`

2. After checking to make sure you have all the requirements (see Chapter 2), create your app with the command `react-native init assembliesTutorial`


### Basic Requirements

The steps that follow assume you’ve met React Native’s basic requirements, which are:

1. You’re using OS X, since it is (and will definitely continue to be) required for any iOS development.

2. You have [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) installed (a good idea no matter what). Also run ```brew update && brew upgrade``` to be safe.

3. Node.js, 4.0+ (React Native runs on Node)

4. ```brew install watchman```

5. ```brew install flow``` (optional)

We’re paraphrasing the requirements listed in the official React native [documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html). It’s a good idea to check the details there before getting started.
