# Chapter 3: The Beginnings of an App

## Create an App

1. We're going to start a new React Native project. First create a directory where you will store all folders related to the app -- `mkdir assemblies` - `cd assemblies`

2. After checking to make sure you have all the requirements (see Chapter 2), create your app with the command `react-native init assembliesTutorial`

You should see something like this: ![installing](Screen Shot 2016-04-07 at 7.34.18 PM.png)

3. Once the React Native packager is done installing, you will see a list of the packages installed by `NPM` (in a nested tree structure) and instructions on running the app. ![](Screen Shot 2016-04-07 at 7.37.19 PM.png)
