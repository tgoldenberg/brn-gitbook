# Chapter 14: Deploying to the App Store

Great, so we've built all the features we want to build and refactored our code. Now we want to show it to our friends! How can we do that? 

For that, we need to do several things. Our ultimate goal is to have our app available on the App Store. But for that to happen, there are some steps we should take.

1. We need to add an app icon and splash image
2. We need to create an Apple Developer account
2. We need to test on an actual device
3. We need to share the app with beta testers through Testflight
4. We need to deploy the app to the App Store and get it approved


## App Icons

Apple has specific size requirements for app icons and launch images, which can be quite confusing. Luckily, there are some online tools that make it easier. If you have a high-resolution image that you wish to use for your icon or launch screen, you can visit www.makeappicon.com and download a folder with all the different sizes.

# Creating an Apple Developer Account

One of the best tutorials on creating an Apple Developer account is originally by Ray Wenderlich, since edited by Tony Dahbura. The full post is [here](https://www.raywenderlich.com/127936/submit-an-app-part-1).
