## Installing React Native

We'll begin our app on iOS since the development workflow is a bit easier, and add instructions for porting your app to Android in the later chapters. 

### Basic Requirements

The steps that follow assume you’ve met React Native’s basic requirements, which are:

1. You’re using OS X, since it is (and will definitely continue to be) required for any iOS development.

2. You have [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) installed (a good idea no matter what). Also run ```brew update && brew upgrade``` to be safe.

3. Node.js, 4.0+ (React Native runs on Node)

4. ```brew install watchman```

We’re paraphrasing the requirements listed in the official React native [documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html). It’s a good idea to check the details there before getting started.

Make sure you have the latest version of [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download/) installed. When Apple rolls out new major releases of Xcode (and often even in minor releases), breaking changes are often introduced. Do yourself a favor and start out with the latest to avoid serious pain later.


## Creating your First Project

Here’s where things get really exciting - we’re going to install React Native on our system and get our first project up and running on iOS.

### Install the React Native Command Line Interface (CLI)

This should be pretty familiar if you’ve used CLI's like Rails or Ember:

```npm install -g react-native-cli```

This will install all of the React Native and React packages you need, in addition to installing all of the command line helpers you’ll use for building, running, and building your apps. You only need to do this once per system.

The `-g` flag tells **npm** to install the CLI in our system's global scope, that way we'll be able to access the CLI commands from any folder.

### Create a React Native Project

So far, so good. Now let’s get a project up and running. it’s good practice to keep all of your coding projects in one place, like **~/ReactNativeProjects**. Navigate to your working directory and create a new project:

```cd ~/ReactNativeProjects```

```react-native init assemblies```

In this guide we’ll be building a community app for developers similar to Meetup called "Assemblies," but you can name your project whatever you like.

Now navigate to your new project’s directory:

`cd assemblies`

## Basic Structure of a React Native Project

Before we test out our new project, let’s explain a little bit about how React Native projects are structured. This will be enormously helpful to understand later, especially when we start working on  both the iOS and Android versions of a project simultaneously.

To open your project, you should use a text editor such as Atom, Sublime, Vim, Emacs, etc. We'll be using [Atom](https://atom.io/) for the tutorial, and we'll also provide some tips later for speeding up your performance with custom packages. In any case, open up your project with your favorite text editor.

You should see something like this:
```
android
ios
node_modules
.buckconfig
.flowconfig
.gitignore
.watchmanconfig
index.android.js
index.ios.js
package.json
```

`package.json` - works like it does in any other Node project - it’s a Javascript object containing all of the npm package dependencies your project has, as well as basic metadata and any scripts that should be included. Right now it’s pretty unimpressive:

```javascript
{
  "name": "assembliesTutorial",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node node_modules/react-native/local-cli/cli.js start"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "15.2.1",
    "react-native": "0.30.0"
  }
}
```

Right now we only have two package dependencies, "react-native" and "react", at versions 0.30.0 and 15.2.1, respectively. It’s important to note this version number at the outset. React Native is incredible, but the codebase is changing constantly. Whenever you’re debugging issues, especially with third-party libraries, conflicts created by differing React Native version dependencies are often the cause. Try and update at regular intervals, testing in a new branch, so you don’t get too far behind, but play with release candidates at your own risk.

```node_modules```  - contains all of the npm packages, React Native core or otherwise, our project will use.

```index.android.js``` and ```index.ios.js``` - think of these like your `index.html` file in a web project - it’s the starting point for your application, one is for Android, and the other is for iOS.

`.buckconfig` and `.flowconfig` - We can ignore these. The `.gitignore` file will be used later, to make sure sensitive information doesn't get published to source control.

```android``` and ```ios``` - these folders contain all of the native code the Android and iOS platforms require to run and bundle apps. We’ll introduce different aspects of each directory as we build our project

## Running our Project on iOS


To check out our new project on iOS, simply start Xcode from your "Applications" folder and open the ```assembliesTutorial.xcodeproj``` file in your project’s `ios` folder.

``` open ios/assembliesTutorial.xcodeproj```

Assuming you have iOS Simulator devices installed, you can simply go to Project > Run in the menu or hit `⌘-R` on your keyboard. The iOS Simulator will open and if everything went according to plan, you should see this:

![alt text](/images/chapter-2-getting-started/beginning-react-native-project-screen-on-ios.png "Beginning React Native project screen on iOS")

You’ll also notice Xcode has opened a Terminal window:

![alt text](/images/chapter-2-getting-started/react-native-packager-terminal-window.png "React native packager Terminal window")

This window holds the React Native packager’s process, which will interpret all of our Javascript code into native code Xcode can understand.

## Debugging

One incredible feature of React Native is that it lets you debug your Javascript directly in Chrome as you interact with the Simulator. To turn on debugging, go to the Simulator, hit `Cmd + D`, and select "Debug JS Remotely." You'll notice a new Chrome tab open. To see console output, just open up the Chrome Developer Tools. 

## Hot Loading

Some other options in the debugging menu are `Enable Live Reload` and `Enable Hot Reloading`. This enables us to make changes in our code without restarting the project to see the effect. This is really useful when it comes to deciding on content and styles.

## Adding Packages

One of the best things about building apps in React Native is you get access to npm, currently the largest open source library on the planet. We’ll use a lot of different npm packages throughout this guide for a variety of purposes.

Installing a new package works just like it does in any other Node project. Make sure you’re in your project’s root folder and run:

```npm install moment --save```

You can also use the package `yarn` if you have it installed. Check out the [documentation](https://yarnpkg.com/). The command with `yarn` would be `yarn add moment`.

Here we’re installing the marvelous [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/) package which we’ll be using to format dates easily in our project. Adding the `--save` flag is essential, as `npm install` only installs the package locally - ```--save``` will add the package as a dependency in `package.json` so it will get bundled with our app.

Opening up `package.json`, we can see that `moment` has been added:

```
{
  "name": "assembliesTutorial",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node node_modules/react-native/local-cli/cli.js start"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "moment": "^2.14.1",
    "react": "15.2.1",
    "react-native": "0.30.0"
  }
}
```

If you prefer not to use the CLI, you can also edit `packages.json` directly to accomplish the same thing. Sometimes this makes it easier if you're adding many packages at once. If you do things this way, make sure to run `npm install` from you project's root directory once you've saved `package.json` to actually download the packages.

## Setting Up a Git Repo

Now it’s time to set up a Git repo to version control our project and make undoing mistakes or testing new feature ideas super easy. From your project’s root, run:

```git init```
